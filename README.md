### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This Python script creates a Discord bot using the discord.py library. The bot listens to messages and responds with predefined actions based on the content of the messages. It also supports rating and retrieving ratings for users. The bot utilizes Discord intents to listen to specific events and commands.

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

#### Bot Token <a name="bot-token"></a>
Before running the bot, you need to replace the empty string in the `bot.run('')` line with your actual bot token. You can obtain a bot token by creating a new bot on the Discord Developer Portal.

#### Intents <a name="intents"></a>
The bot uses Discord intents to determine which events it should listen to. In this script, the `message_content` intent is enabled to listen to message content. If you need to listen to additional events, you can modify the `intents` setup.

#### External Data <a name="external-data"></a>
The bot reads and writes ratings data to a JSON file named `ratings.json`. Make sure this file exists in the same directory as the script. Ratings are stored as a dictionary with member IDs as keys and ratings as values.

### Events <a name="events"></a>

#### on_ready_ <a name="on_ready_"></a>
This event is triggered when the bot is successfully logged in and connected to Discord. It prints the bot's name and ID to the console.

### Commands <a name="commands"></a>

#### say_ <a name="say_"></a>
Usage: `_say_ <text>`

This command makes the bot send a message containing the specified text to the channel where the command was issued.

#### talk_ <a name="talk_"></a>
Usage: `_talk_ <text>`

This command analyzes the input text and responds with pre-defined messages based on specific keywords present in the text. It supports keywords like "purpose," "credit," "love," "hug," "date," "music," "dream," "movie," "exercise," "l," "angry," "bye," and "pic." If none of these keywords are detected, a default response is sent.

#### set_ <a name="set_"></a>
Usage: `_set_ <member> [rating]`

This command allows you to set a rating for a specific member. The member's ID and the desired rating (optional, default is 0) are provided as arguments. The ratings are stored in the `ratings` dictionary and saved to the `ratings.json` file.

#### rate_ <a name="rate_"></a>
Usage: `_rate_ <member>`

This command retrieves the rating of a specific member. If the member has been rated before, their rating is displayed. If the member hasn't been rated, a message indicating that the user hasn't been rated before is sent.

Remember to handle error cases and input validation appropriately in your code. This documentation provides an overview of the existing commands and their functionality. You can extend and customize the bot's commands and responses according to your preferences.
